"Don’t let the muggles get you down, because they don’t understand the magic in you." – Ron Weasley

Muggles get me down on the daily. I have worked and excelled at many different jobs in my life, but never one I've considered my career. I live a magical "extra-curricular" life. I organize the NYC Harry Potter meetup, spin a flag in color guard, cosplay & go to comic book conventions. I’ve come to accept that my job as a Database Administrator would be a means to an end, there to supporting my super-powered adventures. 

But things have changed. I'm ready to be excited about my career – and I'd like coding to be my newest superpower. This is what brought me to Flatiron School. 

I’m a creative person who enjoys figuring things out. The Flatiron School is testing my problem-solving abilities every day. The Hashes Manipulation Lab almost took me out this week, but I was surprised how much my database knowledged helped me draw parallels to what I already knew!

The lab used a list of holidays, seasons, and decorations in the form of a hash and required us to…

**DBA MUSINGS: This is a database!**

… manipulate it by adding decorations & holidays, 

**DBA MUSINGS: I’m adding info to records!**

… output only certain info,

**DBA MUSINGS: This is a query list**

… and format the list to print in an organized fashion. 

**DBA MUSINGS: I’m exporting!**

If that's not magic, then I don't know what is. And maybe my muggle job is helping me in more ways than I thought. #codingmagic #codeeverydamnday 

*"I am a Harry Potter fan, not a member of the Wiccan community," she explains to the muggles in the room.
